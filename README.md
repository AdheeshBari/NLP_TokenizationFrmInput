# NLP_TokenizationFrmInput
This script tokenizes user-inputted text into sentences and words using NLTK for basic NLP analysis.

This Python script utilizes the NLTK library to tokenize text entered by the user into sentences and words, supporting foundational NLP tasks.

How It Works:
1. User Input: The script prompts the user to enter a text string directly.
2. Sentence Tokenization: The sent_tokenize function from NLTK breaks the user’s input into sentence tokens.
3. Word Tokenization: The word_tokenize function further divides each sentence into individual words and punctuation tokens.
4. Output: The script prints both the sentence tokens and word tokens, making it easy to analyze the structure and components of the user’s text.
This script is a straightforward tool for experimenting with NLP tokenization on any text input provided directly by the user.
